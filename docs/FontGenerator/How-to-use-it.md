# How to use the generator

You can see a demo [here](https://tools.petarmc.com/font-generator/)



## Embedding the RGB Generator in your website
To add the Font generator to your website, follow these steps:

1. Copy the iframe code:
```html
<iframe src="https://tools.petarmc.com/font-generator/" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```
2. Paste the code into your website

## No website? No problem.
If you don't have a website to embed the Font Generator or if you simply want to try it out without integrating it into your site, you can still use the [demo](https://tools.petarmc.com/font-generator/) version.
