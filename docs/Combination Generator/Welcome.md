# Combination Generator

This generator is a Python script designed to generate all possible combinations of symbols (letters and numbers) from a given input string. 

## How it works

This Python script works by prompting you to input a string containing letters and numbers, 
as well as the desired length of combinations.
It then utilizes the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of the specified length from the input string, **allowing for repetition of characters**. After generating the combinations,
the script saves the unique combinations to a text file. Each file is named after the input string and stored in a combinations folder within the working directory.

## Ways of using the generator

1. [Run the script](getting-started/running-the-script)


2. Use an executable (`.exe`) file

:::warning
Using the executable file is NOT RECOMMENDED. Prefer using the [script](https://github.com/PetarMc1/combination-generator/tree/v1.0.0)
